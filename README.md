Reflection

This was actually a super fun project to do as I actually had a lot to learn regarding the things I needed/wanted to implement into my website. This was my first real experience working on a project of this size, and it was a super fun project to work on even if it took me hours.

With more time, I definitely would have been able to implement other things such as music and different categories for the words. I definitely struggled with making the actual game look visually appealing. The timer was also complicated and took me a while to get the coding right.
